BASIC GAME RULES:
In Tetris, you must arrange a sequence of small shapes called Tetraminos, into complete lines.
As each line is completed, it will disappear from the screen.
Tetraminos fall from the top of the play field to the bottom.
Each Tetramino is made up of four blocks, arranged into seven different patterns.
A player loses if a Tetramino cannot fall into his board, therefore the other player will win.
BASIC KEYS:
Left Player:
a - move left, d - move right
s - rotate clockwise, w - rotate counter-clockwise
x - drop Tetramino
Right Player:
j - move left, l - move right
k - rotate clockwise, i - rotate counter-clockwise
